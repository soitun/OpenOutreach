### 🚀 What is OpenOutreach?

OpenOutreach is a **self-hosted, open-source lead finder that qualifies for you — and then writes
the email.** You describe your product and your target market; it discovers matching people from a
**licensed data provider**, judges each one against the ICP it learned from your description, hands
you the ones that fit **with the reason each was chosen written out**, and opens the conversation
from your own mailbox.

Two things make that different from what you may have used before:

- **Unlike a cold-email sequencer, you don't bring a list.** There is nothing to upload. The input
  is a sentence about your product.
- **Unlike a lead database, the output is not rows.** It is a verdict per person, in plain language
  you can read and disagree with — and correcting the description is how you correct the verdicts.

It has **zero platform-ToS surface**: browserless, no social-network account, no scraping. There is
no account to get banned, because there is no account.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
uv tool install openoutreach
openoutreach
```

That is the whole thing. A bare `openoutreach` onboards you if it has to, finds leads that fit,
buys a verified work address for each, and emails them from your mailbox — narrating what it did as
it goes. One install, one wizard, one command.

Prefer to say it out loud, or to set the size of the first run?

```bash
openoutreach run 5        # find five leads carrying an address, then send — at most 5 credits
```

**The verbs:**

```bash
openoutreach                  # onboard if needed, then find and send
openoutreach run 5            # ...with an explicit goal
openoutreach init             # onboard only — one flow, every answer, nothing spent
openoutreach init --product-docs product.md --target target.md   # ...the two long fields from files
openoutreach find 10          # ten more qualified leads → CSV on stdout — free, cannot spend
openoutreach find 10 emails   # ...carrying a work email (one credit each)
openoutreach find 0           # no work — print what you already have
openoutreach send             # mail what is already stored
openoutreach send 5           # ...until five conversations are open
openoutreach status           # what is configured, blocked and counted
```

Everything lives in `~/.openoutreach`, so stopping and starting loses nothing: the number you ask
for is *more than you already have*, so running it again continues where it left off. No browser,
no daemon manager, no container.

## 🤖 Use it from Claude Code

This repo ships a **Claude Code plugin**, so you can pull leads without leaving your agent session:

```
/plugin marketplace add eracle/OpenOutreach
/plugin install openoutreach@openoutreach
```

The skill (`skills/find-leads/SKILL.md`) teaches Claude when to run `find`, which flags cost credits
and which cannot, how to read the CSV on stdout, and what each `error: <type>` means. It never buys
an address you did not ask for, never sends without being asked, and never accepts the legal notice
for you. Prefer skills to plugins? Copy `skills/find-leads/` into `~/.claude/skills/` instead.

**Not on Claude Code?** The skill is a markdown file describing the CLI's own contract — nothing
Claude-specific is required to use `openoutreach` itself. Codex, Cursor, or any other agent can call
the same `openoutreach find` / `send` / `run` / `status` commands directly; point your agent's
instructions file at `skills/find-leads/SKILL.md` and it reads the same rules.

---

## 🧩 Three packages, one product

OpenOutreach is an **orchestrator**. The finding and the sending are two standalone programs, and
this package installs both and hosts them in one process, one database and one onboarding:

| Package | What it is | Standalone |
|---|---|---|
| [**OpenOutFind**](https://github.com/eracle/OpenOutFind) | discovery, qualification, enrichment, the CRM | `uvx --from openoutfind outfind find 10` |
| [**OpenOutSend**](https://github.com/eracle/OpenOutSend) | the outreach agent, the mailbox, the send guards | `uvx --from openoutsend outsend send` |
| **OpenOutreach** (this) | one install, one wizard, one command over both | — |

**The wizard is here because the children do not have one.** Both are agent-first: they read their
configuration from `OPENOUTFIND_*` / `OUTSEND_*` on every run and remember none of it, which is
right for a program a script or an agent drives and wrong for a person. So this is where the
questions are asked, where the answers are kept, and where they are handed to each child in its own
variables.

**Neither child is diminished by the bundle.** Each keeps its own console script, its own settings
module and its own test suite, and the contract between them is a public one:

```bash
outfind find 50 --json | outsend      # anybody's producer, anybody's receiver
outsend send                          # a separate invocation, on the mailbox's clock
```

`openoutreach run` is that same pipe, in one process — the JSON Lines still cross the boundary, they
just cross it in a buffer. There is no privileged in-memory hand-off, because a second, untested path
between the same two programs would make the public one a lie.

**Which shape is for you:** if you are an agent, a script, or a power user with your own sender,
take the two CLIs and the pipe. If you want to see whether this works, take the one command.

---

## 📤 What You Get Out

The finder's deliverable is a file, and it is shaped for the tools you already send with:

```bash
openoutreach find 10 emails > leads.csv
```

It runs until it has ten more leads carrying an address, prints **every lead you have** as CSV, and
exits — so the file you just wrote is always the current truth. Exit 0 means it got what you asked
for; anything short still prints its rows and says why it stopped.

```
email, first_name, last_name, company, title, website, linkedin_url, reason, lead_id, qualified_at
```

Those column names are **the importers', not ours**. Instantly and Smartlead both require
`email`/`first_name`/`last_name` and recognise `company`/`title`/`website`/`linkedin_url` as standard
fields, so an exported file imports **without column mapping**. Anything else — including `reason` —
arrives as a custom variable you can merge into a template.

- **`reason` is the point.** Everybody exports rows; almost nobody exports *why this lead*.
- **There is no score column, on purpose.** The model's confidence is a spend gate for the paid
  lookup, not a quality signal. The fit verdict is the LLM's, and it is already in the file as a
  sentence.
- **A lead with no email still exports.** If you have no email-finder credits, you still get the
  qualified person, their employer and the reason.
- **A rejected lead never exports.** Both rejections are excluded, always.

> **If you send with your own tool:** turn on its *import dedupe*. It is opt-in on Smartlead and
> undocumented on Instantly, so a lead you export twice can otherwise be contacted twice.

## 📋 What You Need

| # | What | Example |
|---|------|---------|
| 1 | **An LLM API key** | OpenAI, Anthropic, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| 2 | **An email-finder API key** ([BetterContact](https://bettercontact.rocks?fpr=openoutreach)) | **Free account: 40 credits, no card.** Powers **both** discovery (Lead Finder, billed nothing) and enrichment (one credit per verified work email) |
| 3 | **A product description + target market** | "We sell cloud cost optimization for DevOps teams at mid-market SaaS companies" |
| 4 | **A mailbox to send from** | Its address and an **app password** — not your login password. Google Workspace works out of the box; any other provider names its SMTP/IMAP host and port |

Onboarding asks for all four in one pass and **asks only once** — the answers are kept in
`~/.openoutreach`, and every later run exports them into the variables the children read. A question
whose variable is already exported is not asked at all, so an operator or a unit file that sets
`OPENOUTFIND_*` / `OUTSEND_*` never has to repeat it into a prompt; that is what makes a headless
install possible. With no TTY and something still unanswered, setup stops **naming the variables**
that would have answered it rather than blocking on a question nobody is there to hear.

The two long fields are read from files, not flags — a markdown paragraph shell-quoted onto a
command line corrupts quietly:

```bash
openoutreach init --product-docs product.md --target target.md
```

The LLM key is **verified at the prompt**, and the mailbox by a real SMTP login before setup
finishes: a wrong key is an answer you can retype, not a traceback halfway through a run.

The BetterContact link above is an **affiliate link** — signing up through it supports OpenOutreach,
at no markup to you.

**Why choose OpenOutreach?**

- 🧠 **You don't need a list** — describe your product; it finds candidates from licensed data
- 📝 **A stated reason per lead** — read exactly why the agent picked someone, and fix the description when it is wrong
- 🔍 **Nothing decides in the dark** — the ICP, the verdicts and the whole pipeline are on your machine and open to read
- 🛡️ **Zero platform-ToS surface** — browserless, no social-network account, no scraping — nothing to get banned
- 💸 **Pay only for what resolves** — searching is free; a paid lookup is rationed and billed on a verified hit
- 📤 **Or export where you already work** — CSV in the shape the sequencer importers expect
- ⚡ **One-command setup** — `uv tool install openoutreach && openoutreach`

Every comparable tool that qualifies leads for you is paid SaaS. This one is GPLv3, runs on your
machine, and you bring your own provider keys.

---

## 💸 How OpenOutreach Stays Free

**Affiliate links, and that is now the whole of it.** The one paid third-party service the tool
relies on — the lead-data provider — is surfaced during onboarding through an affiliate link. Sign
up through it and the project may earn a commission, **at no markup to you**. Sign up any other way
if you prefer. See the **[Legal Notice](LEGAL_NOTICE.md)** (§4).

## 📖 How It Works

**Discover → qualify → gate → resolve → write → send.**

1. **You provide** a product description and a campaign objective
2. **An LLM turns that into opening search keywords** and pages matching firmographic profiles from
   a **licensed discovery source** (BetterContact Lead Finder) — no emails yet, billed nothing
3. **Discovery walks the keyword index by counting**, adding one word at a time and spending its next
   query where the accepted-lead counts say the best ones came from
4. **An LLM qualifies each candidate** against your ICP and **writes down why**. A Gaussian Process
   over profile embeddings learns from those verdicts and picks who to qualify next
5. **A confidence gate rations the one paid step** — a work address is resolved for the best-fit
   leads only, one credit per verified hit
6. **The outreach agent writes each opener** from the same product description, and the send guards
   (sending window, daily cap, pacing) decide when it actually leaves your mailbox

Steps 1–5 are [OpenOutFind](https://github.com/eracle/OpenOutFind)'s and step 6 is
[OpenOutSend](https://github.com/eracle/OpenOutSend)'s; each repo documents its own internals.
Searching the licensed source is free, so the system can afford to look at a lot and spend paid
lookups only on the best fits. *(The learning loop is an active experiment — it is not yet shown to
beat picking at random, and no claim is made that it does.)*

## 📂 Project Structure

This repo is the orchestrator and holds no pipeline of its own — that is the point of it:

```
├── openoutreach/
│   ├── __main__.py     # the `openoutreach` console script: find · send · status · run
│   ├── settings.py     # one Django registry hosting both children's apps, on one database
│   ├── config/         # the one model: the answers you gave, and the variables they export as
│   └── wizard.py       # one onboarding — ask once, keep it, hand it to both children
├── tests/              # the registry, the wizard's row and export, the CLI's own decisions
├── manage.py           # checkout shim over openoutreach/__main__.py
├── pyproject.toml      # package metadata, pinned children, console script
├── local.yml           # Docker Compose — the server deploy only
└── Makefile            # Shortcuts (setup, run, find, test)
```

---

## ⚙️ Local Installation (Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eracle/OpenOutreach.git
cd OpenOutreach
make setup              # install -e ".[dev]" + migrate both children's apps
make run                # onboard, find, send
make test
```

Working on the pipeline itself? It is not here — clone
[OpenOutFind](https://github.com/eracle/OpenOutFind) or
[OpenOutSend](https://github.com/eracle/OpenOutSend), and point this project at your checkout with
`uv pip install -e ../OpenOutFind`.

Running it on a server instead? A Docker image is published to GitHub Container Registry for exactly
that — see the **[Docker Guide](./docs/docker.md)**.
